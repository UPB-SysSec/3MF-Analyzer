scopes:
  3D Manufacturing Format: |
    Attacks/Tests that pertain to general properties of the 3MF specification.
  3D Model Part: |
    Attacks/Tests that affect the 3D model part (the `*.model` file(s)) of the 3MF specification.
  XML: |
    Attacks/Tests on/with the XML standard that don't work on specifics of the 3MF standard.
    Using entities is explicitly forbidden in the 3MF standard.
    Hence, all tests in this scope are invalid according to the 3MF specification.
  ZIP: |
    Attacks/Tests on/with the ZIP standard that don't work on specifics of the 3MF standard.

types:
  Functionality:
    description: |
      Tests that check whether a certain functionality/attack works at all/in general.
  Denial of Service:
    description: |
      Attacks that try to interrupt the availability of the software.
  Content Spoofing:
    description: |
      Attacks that try to present the user fake or modified data.
    subtypes:
      Reference Confusion:
        description: |
          General attacks to test the behavior of various invalid/weird references.
        subtypes:
          Referenced Object Duplication:
            description: |
              Some referenced object/ID is available two times.
              The program might choose one or the other, or fail.
          Referenced Object Broken:
            description: |
              Attacks where a property (e.g. an XML attribute/element) is referenced that does not exist/is invalid.
              The program might ignore the reference, or fail.
          Reference Broken:
            description: |
              Tests where a reference was removed/made invalid.
              This might lead to an error (reference was required) or might simply change the output (referenced element no longer part of the model).
          Model Reference Functionality:
            description: |
              Tests that check whether the software respects the `.rels` file in regard to the root 3D model part, or not.
              There are two possible files in the compressed folder:
              - 3dmodel means a file named `/3D/3dmodel.model`.
              - other means a file named `/3D/other.model`.
              The title of the testcase indicates whether the file exists and if it is referenced, or not.
              The encoding is:
              ```
              E = file exists, R = file is referenced.
              0 = statement is false, 1 = statement is true.
              ```

              Hence, `3dmodel: E0 R1` means that the file `/3D/3dmodel.model` does not exist, but is references in in the `.rels` files.
      Property Confusion:
        description: |
          Attacks where a property of the model is manipulated so that parsers might react in different ways.

          Attacks in this general category have properties that are represented in multiple different places.
          These are not always invalid (but might be).
          For example, a structure might have an alternative representation and the software chooses one depending on the context (thumbnails, extensions, ...).
        subtypes:
          Property Valid:
            description: |
              Tests where a property (e.g. an XML attribute/element) of the model is changed to another valid value.
              Tests whether this is applied correctly by the program.
          Property Invalid:
            description: |
              Attacks where a property (e.g. an XML attribute/element) of the model is invalid.
              The program might ignore or sanitize the property, or fail.
          Property Duplication:
            description: |
              Attacks where a property (e.g. an XML attribute/element) of the model is duplicated in the same place.
              The program might choose the first or second, or fail.
      Namespace Confusion:
        description: |
          XML namespaces invalid/mispleading.
  Data Extraction:
    description: |
      Attacks where the file can be used to extract data from the system they are running on.
    subtypes:
      In-Band:
        description: |
          The extracted data is contained in the 3MF file itself or the attacker otherwise received direct feedback containing the extracted data.
          The attacker can only access it if a 3MF file is returned, or the data from the file is displayed directly (e.g. in the Metadata).
          This is mainly relevant for online services (e.g. a Mesh Repair Service).
      Out-Of-Band:
        description: |
          The extracted data cannot be directly accessed.
          The data is send to an attacker-controlled server through a request from the attacked software.
  Miscellaneous:
    description: |
      Attacks/Tests that do not fit in with other categories, or are not yet sorted into one.
  Reference:
    description: |
      Attacks/Tests that intent to be valid and act as a reference/comparison for other tests.
